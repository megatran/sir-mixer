# Sir-Mixer

One teammate recently turned 21 and the team jokingly suggested making a smart cocktail mixer to brighten up his mood. After some discussions regarding fun features with the hackathon sponsors and figuring out the neat business potential of a smart assistant which can mix all kind of drinks from well-known distilled beverages, family-friendly juices, to get-up-and-go energy refreshment, we decided to turn this idea into reality and also learn new technologies (e.g. Qualcomm board, Microsoft Azure and API, etc) along the way!

### Requirements
see requirements.txt
* Amazon Alexa
* Arduinos
* Qualcomm dragonboard
* Microsoft Azure
* Microsoft Cognitive services APIs


### How we built it:

During the the fun weekend doing the IoT project, we kept in mind that Sir Mixer could serve a wide array of consumers/users.

Tech savy people who enjoy smart assistant (e.g. Alexa) could ask Sir Mixer to make their desired cocktail.
People who come home with certain moods after a long day can be satisfied with personalized mixed drinks which can be automatically triggered when Sir Mixer recognize your facial expressions using the Microsoft Cognitive Services.
We wired all electronics and designed the hardware prototype from scratch (took 2 iterations).
We spent countless hours going over documentations of new technologies most of us have rarely used. We're so glad that the engineers and developer evangelist spent time and helped us over the weekend: from discussing how to build resilient server architecture, the possibilities of the API of emotion and speech recognition, to suggesting some cool ideas for our project, and many more!
